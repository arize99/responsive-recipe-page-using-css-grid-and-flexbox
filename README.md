### What I learned

I learned a lot of things working on this project.
<ul>
<li> Setting list items has never been more convenient.</li>
<li> Though there were strong deliberations on how to style a particular aspect. It pays to finally come to a conclusion on how best to do it.</li>
<li> I was pushed to learn how to space text items as I want by spanning text in-between and using the 

```css
.{
  display: inline-block
}
```
to give texts a desired border width.</li>
<li>I learned how to color and style ordered and unordered list items</li>
</ul>

### Continued development

I want to make this page responsive as soon as possible. I did not start with mobile responsive.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with most of the CSS code supports.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - This is amazing search engine that helped me remember most of the codes I forgot. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning coding. üòâ
